# snake_game

Here is a snake game I coded from 100 days of code on Udemy. 
There are some personalized code differences (mostly in naming variables), but the biggest difference I added was,
  Instead of the game ending when the snake hits a wall, I made the snake go to the opposite side of the board. This way the only way for the game
  to end is to eat your own tail. This makes the game go for much longer.
